# Learning PostgreSQL

## What is this?
Things That Are Green is a site that celebrates the color green. Log on, create an account, start listing things that are green. That's it.

This project focuses on the basics of building out an Express app with PostgreSQL. This is my first Express app that uses PostgresSQL. I've built a similar Express app using SQLite, but never deployed it.

The app is deployed on Heroku here:
