# Learning PostgreSQL

## What is this?
Green Things is a site that celebrates the color green. Create an account. Log in. Check out the gallery. Start adding things that are green.  That's it.

As you may gathered by now, this is a demonstration project. This project focuses on building out an Express app with PostgreSQL. I've built other apps using SQLite, but this is my first using PostgreSQL, and the first that I've deployed to Heroku.

The app is deployed here:
